The Beucher gradient (also called Morphological gradient) is the dirrerence between the erosion and the dilation of an image. The erosion of A by B is defined by the union of the translations of B that are fully inside A. The dilation of A by B is the union of the translations of B whose center is inside A. Substracting the 2 only leave use with the edges of the image. The only parameter for this method is the size of the kernel used for the dilation and the erosion. We could also modify the shape of this kernel, but we didn't find major differences between the shapes, so we left a square kernel.
